# Kalman-Filter-Python
An implementation of a Kalman filter using numpy and matplotlib in python
The implementation is very strongly influenced by the tutorial presented at: http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/

The variable names are meant to match the ones presented in the tutorial. I have added plenty of comments to explain their meaning, so even without the tutorial, the code should still be usable with a basic undersanding of Kalman filters.
